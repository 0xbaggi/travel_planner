# ðŸ“– About Travel Planner
This project aims to build a simple application that helps users plan trips to any city in the world. This information is provided by GeminiAPI, using various predefined prompts. Users can select a city from a dropdown list, as well as choose the day's duration and the maximum hourly duration of activities for each day. All information is displayed on the last Liquid Galaxy screen and on the tablet. The user will also fly to the selected city on the Liquid Galaxy rig.
